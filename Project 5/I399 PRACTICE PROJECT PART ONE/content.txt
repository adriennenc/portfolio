** ARTICLE #ABOUT

Studio Artiflora is a premiere home-based floral design studio located in lovely historic Granville, Ohio, home of Denison University. Featuring hand-tied bouquets and table arrangements using unique materials, and Dutch-influenced designs.

Artiflora's signature work is the European style hand-tied bouquet, a vase-ready artistically designed gathering of beautiful blooms, buds and leaves. Creative designs often feature natural materials like branches, stones, moss and berries, used for structures that support beautiful flowers.
