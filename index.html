			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> I am a former student at Indiana University Bloomington who majored in Informatics with a cognate in business. When it comes to computing, I have had much practice with systems like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I have also had much practice in Microsoft Access and Excel.</p>
			<p>Along with my practice in different computing systems, I have also had much practice in the field of human-computer interaction design. I am able to talk with clients about what they think of a project, what they expect, and helping complete their project in a timely manner.</p> 
			<p> Along with my practice with different computing systems, I have also had much practice in other fields such as archaeology, astronomy, chemistry, biology, different times in history, and literature.</p>
			
			<h2>About This Website</h2>
			<p>This website is made so that you can learn more about me. On this website, you wil be able to get to know me as a person, have access to my contact information, get to see, and go to, some of the websites that I have built, and will be able to see/ download my resume.</p>
