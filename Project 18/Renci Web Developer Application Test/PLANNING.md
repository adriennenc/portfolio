How I planned to build this application:

Firstly, I read throught the instructions and made a step by step plan architecture on how the code should work. For instance, I thought, first the code should choose two random numbers. I then knew that the code needed to add the two numbers together. After this, I made the decision to put the sum of the two numbers into an array because I felt it would be the easiest to compare what was in an array, to what the user had input. 

After this, I created the user input section. This was simply a text box that recognized the text as numbers. Once this was completed I concluded that the simplest way to get whether or not the user input was correct or not was an IF statement. So I created an IF statement comparing the sum that was in the array, and the number that the user had given.

Once all of this was completed, it was simple testing and fixing small errors that were stoping the code from working.




What would I add/ what testing did I do/did I do:

During the creation, I did have some testing going on in the code to see where errors were happening/ why it would jump straight to the else of the IF statement.

If I had the option, I would make it more user optional. That meaning, the user could decide whether they wanted to get practice with addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication; or possibly even more complex mathematical equations.

I considered at the end to make a fake logo, but decided against it; so I would say that yes, I would definitely choose to try and brand the application if possible, along with make it have more color.
