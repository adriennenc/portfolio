Addition Help README:

What this application does:

"Addition Help" contributes to children and their addition skills by using hands on learning using these core uses:

1.) Two random numbers are chosen from 1 to 100 for the child to see.

2.) The child enters into the text back what they think the sum of the two numbers is. If they are correct, it says correct, if not, they are able to try again.

3.) The page gives continous learning becuase adddition problems will always be different just by refreshing the page.



How other developers can contribute to the code:

Developers can contribute in ways such as 

1.) Expanding the mathecmatical difficulty (i.e. adding in subtraction, multiplication, etc. problems.
2.) Expanding the number count. At the moment, it is set to only go between 1 and 100. Other developers can expand this to 1000, or higher.


How to build and delpoy this application:

1.) Have Javascript choose two random numbers between 1 and 100
2.) Put the sum of those two numbers into an array.
3.) Have a user enter in what they think the sum of the two numbers is and press the Enter button.
4.) If it is correct (i.e. what the user input was equals what is in the array, have the page say it is correct, otherwise, say it is incorrect.

Other testing options:

5.) Test the code by having it output the sum of the two random numbers, what is in the array, and what the user input. If all of those are equal, the user is correct.
